## Approach :

Create a hashmap and input the roman numerals into the map. After that, iterate the input through the map and retrieve the value. Check if the adjacent roman numeral is bigger or smaller. If its bigger, it needs to be subtracted or else it needs to be added. Return the sum if pointer reaches to end of input numeral.
